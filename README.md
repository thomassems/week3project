# Week 3 Project
# Domain Description:
Our group plans on implementing a fitness-oriented application that will allow for different types of users such as clients, and instructors
When signing up, clients will be able to choose between the basic and VIP membership tier. VIP members will be able to enrol in more workout classes

# Application Description
This application will allow clients to log their workouts, enrol in workout classes, and obtain their own personal workout plan based on their goals with the help of an API
Instructors will be able to create, and remove workout classes that clients are able to enrol in. When creating a workout class, the instructor will specify the type of workout, intensity, length of time, and equipment required
Clients who attend a class will be able to rate the workout class and give feedback.
Clients will also be able to filter the workout classes based on rating, intensity, and type of workout
When displaying the workouts, our application will display the workouts that our algorithm deems as most compatible towards the top, and lesser compatible workout classes near the bottom
Additionally, the app will track users' fitness progress, offer personalized workout suggestions, and facilitate communication between instructors and clients for a comprehensive gym experience.

We used Hoppscotch to get 10 exercises based on the muscle we entered in the query parameters.
We can enter different muscle groups to get different kinds of exercises.
